# Becoming a (more) creative front-end developer

## Introduction

Creative front-end developer, ninja-coder, rockstar developer, these are all buzzword job titles companies use when hiring. They can be vague and meaningless, but they don't have to be.

A "creative developer" can be just a title, I'd say it has more meaning than ninja-developer, but what defines being creative? Who can or can't call themselves a creative developer and should you even care?

If you're looking to stay on top of your game, keep track of all the latest technologies, techniques and trends when it comes to the web and you have an interest in amazing visual design an animations and creating award winning web experiences, then the answer is yes, you should care. Not about the title, but about being creative, becoming more creative and the desire to evolve and develop new skills.

## What is a creative front-end developer?

There's not one specific definition that clearly describes what the title of creative front-end developer means, but to me, it means:

- Being a competent front-end developer
- Having an eye for design
- The ability to code a great user experience

Wait.. don't we have a visual designer and user experience designer to take care of those last two points?

Yes, but let me explain why being creative, is more than just being able to code any (generic) static website. It's being able to create innovative, sometimes experimental web experiences that have a 'wow' factor, more on that later.

### Being a competent developer

It starts with the core ability to code websites. Knowing your way around HTML, CSS and JavaScript and writing code in a competent way. Meaning, writing code that works. The ability to code a super complex transition between elements is worthless if that animation freezes or only works in a single browser.

### Having an eye for design

Designers shouldn't code and developers shouldn't design. That's a phrase I've seen and heard plenty of times before and I agree, to an extent.

One way to go about being a front-end developer in a team, is to code exactly what the visual designer delivers to you, without giving it any thought. After all, your job is to code.

That's fine, and you can be the most amazing front-end developer that can code anything that's handed to you, but in my experience, being able to talk **with** (not against!) a visual designer and having somewhat of an eye for design is never a bad thing.

You don't have to be a visual design expert, but working in teams, is working together. A visual designer can overlook something and the ability for you to question something, or rather, talk to the designer about it can be beneficial for the team and end product.

**Note:** respect someone's expertise. When working with a visual designer, don't argue about things you find ugly, that's unproductive and will just result in leaving a bad taste in someone's mouth.

### Being able to code a great user experience

Being able to code that transition and animation the UX designer explained is the baseline. Being able to think of those animations on your own, is where you active your creativity.

So does that mean you need to be able to think of all the transitions and animations that would make the user experience that much better? No, that's what the user experience designer does, but, going back to being a competent front-end developer and writing clean, bug-free code, let's use an example of when you should be able to think of a great user experience.

The (UX) designer sends you a video prototype of an amazing transition between two elements. It can happen, that that animation doesn't actually work well, from a performance perspective or just not being smooth when converting it to code.

That's when your creativity, knowledge and expertise can come in handy. Your ability to suggest alternative ways to animate something and work **with** a UX designer, without giving in on performance or the actual experience is another great plus in my book.

## Gaining knowledge, improving skills and becoming more creative

I've laid out three skills required to be a creative front-end developer. Next up, ways to develop and improve these skills.

Earlier I mentioned that a creative front-end developer is able to create web experiences that have a wow factor. Some examples of the kind of projects and experiments I'm talking about:

<small>_[CreativeCrew - Horizontal Navigation](https://partners.cpeople.ru/en/)_</small>

These kind projects are often built with technologies and libraries such as WebGL, Three.js and GSAP and offer an immersive browsing experience by combining UI, interaction and motion design. Now, don't get discouraged if you don't have the knowledge to work on such projects (yet). I'd like to share some resources and tips on how to go about learning more about developing creatively.

### Inspiration

First of all, one of the key principles I follow and recommend to become more creative, is to go out in the field and browse dope stuff!

A couple of amazing resources to browse award winning web experiences:

- [Awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/)
- [TheFWA.com](https://thefwa.com/)
- [CSS-Awards.com](https://css-awards.com/)

To learn more about how some of these projects were made, the [Awwwards blog](https://www.awwwards.com/blog/) contains lots of articles with case studies that dive deep into the thinking and inner workings of how things were designed and built. An example of that is this article about the [Site of the Month September 2020 with 2Â°C EARTH](https://www.awwwards.com/2degc-earth-by-jingqi-fanwins-site-of-the-month-september-2020.html).

### Tutorials

Alright, those award site blog articles don't always **exactly** explain how something was made, that's where one of my favorite resources of all times comes in:

[Codrops | Creative front-end resources and inspiration for web professionals](http://tympanus.net/codrops/)

Not only is Codrops a great place to get inspired, since they showcase the latest trends in web design, it's essentially a one stop shop to learn more about how these award winning sites are created.

Looking to learn more about [Three.js](https://tympanus.net/codrops/tag/three-js/), [WebGL](https://tympanus.net/codrops/tag/webgl/), [SVG Filters](https://tympanus.net/codrops/tag/svg-filter/) or that mind blowing [hover effect](https://tympanus.net/codrops/tag/hover/) you saw on the most recent site of the month? Codrops has a tutorial on it.

### Roll up your sleeves...

... and get to work. Code. Code. Code. As with everything, practice makes perfect, the same goes for improving your creativity and skills as a front-end developer. Codrops has enough material for you to go through for months.

One small tip, grab a tutorial and try to make it your own, look at the end result, don't just copy and paste the code from the tutorial, but add your own twist and variation to really get an idea of how things work. There's no reason you can't use one tutorial to create 5 different versions ;)

#### Do I still have your attention? I have to admit something..

Being a creative front-end developer doesn't mean you have to be able to create an award winning site with the most complex motion design and transitions you've ever seen, they're award winning for a reason. But.. it's a nice goal to strive for right?

So let's say you want to start with something smaller, maybe you just want to get better at micro interactions, adding subtle animations to button interactions, making the experience of just one small UI component feel fluid.

Codrops has some great UI component resources and inspiration to look at, for example [all these button resources](https://tympanus.net/codrops/?s=button&search-type=posts), but another great place for UI inspiration, including motion design and animations is [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/).

**Take for example this download animation:**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78322243/122689794-a2b00680-d225-11eb-8c33-5557984e911a.mp4

Before Aaron Iker [coded this](https://dribbble.com/shots/9683055-Download-animation), it was nothing more than [an animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/2012292-Download-transition) created by Nick Buturishvili.

And that's the beauty of Dribbble. Aaron used a Dribbble shot, as work on there is called, and coded a live version of it. I used that shot for a reason, Aaron actually does this all the time, he takes cool interactions and brings them to live with code. Check out more of his work [here](https://dribbble.com/ai). Click on his work and then click through to the Codepen links he leaves in the descriptions, try to find out how he coded it and learn from it.

You can do the same! Use Dribbble to your advantage. If you find it hard to come up with your own creative concepts to code, just grab a cool shot from Dribbble and try coding it live!

# That's it.

For now. There's more to it than just a few links for you to look at, but hopefully I've giving you enough insight into the world of a creative front-end developer, from my point of view, for you to start and make dope stuff.

So let's get to it. Start absorbing content and information and code, code, code.
